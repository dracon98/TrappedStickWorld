# File Directory Explanation: 
- 
# Henry comments 13/April
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt file.

# Richardo apologies on what henry said on 13/April
- My apologies that the commits + changelog items are not up to your standard at that time
- Last week had been really packed and I will redeem it on these week

# Henry comments 27/April
- Good to see you starting to develop data/
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.

# Richardo on what henry said on 27/April
- There had been a slight bump in which it was related to my laptop and the development needed to be halted between 22-04-2018 until 25-04-2018 and was continued on 26-04-2018
- Compile instructions had been there
- Sorry for the directory explanation will be created as soon as possible
