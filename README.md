(Henry wants to also see both licenses.txt and changelog files)

# Henry comments 13/April
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt file.

# Richardo apologies on what henry said on 13/April
- My apologies that the commits + changelog items are not up to your standard at that time
- Last week had been really packed and I will redeem it on these week
